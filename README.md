# Stewart Calculus Playlists

This repository contains a Jekyll website that organizes YouTube playlists for selected sections of Stewart's Calculus, curated from BlackPenRedPen's channel. This project is an independent initiative and is not affiliated with BlackPenRedPen. The site is designed to help users follow a structured, weekly schedule while accessing these playlists easily.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The homepage featuring an overview, the weekly schedule, and links to each section.
- **_config.yml**: The Jekyll configuration file.
- **Section Files**: Each section (e.g., `5.1.html`, `5.2.html`, etc.) embeds the corresponding YouTube playlist and includes a link to open the playlist in a new tab.


## How to Run Locally

1. **Install Jekyll**:  
   Make sure you have Ruby installed, then install Jekyll and Bundler:
   ```bash
   gem install jekyll bundler
