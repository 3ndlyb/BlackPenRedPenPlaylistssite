<h1>Section 5.1</h1>


<p>
  This section introduces the concept of definite integrals by exploring the calculation of areas under curves and the distances traveled by objects. It discusses approximating these areas using methods such as Riemann sums, which involve summing the areas of rectangles under a curve. This foundational concept leads to the formal definition of the definite integral in subsequent sections.

  For example, the definite integral is represented as:
  $$\int_a^b f(x)\, dx$$
